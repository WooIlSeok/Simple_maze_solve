very basic maze-solving program. It is likely much simpler than you expect.

#Limitations#
The outer walls must form a rectangular shape.
There must be exactly one entrance and one exit.
Any additional images or elements inserted outside of the maze structure may cause the code to malfunction.......
There're too much. Only standard and refined maze formats are supported.
